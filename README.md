This template is used to kickstart CLI apps using [Commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) and Typescript.

The template comes prepared for usage with Firebase, Supabase, or both. Delete src/firebase.ts or src/supabase.ts if you don't need them.

If you're using Supabase you need to create a .env file with the following keys:

```

```

If you're using Firebase you to add a file called `credentials.json` with your Firebase credentials.
